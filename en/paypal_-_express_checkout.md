### Recurring Billing

This new feature allows you to create custom payments very easily, using the following paramters:
 * **Recurring Billing Period**. Unit for billing during this subscription period. For SemiMonth, billing is done on the 1st and 15th of each month.
Note: The combination of BillingPeriod and BillingFrequency cannot exceed one year. You can select the billing period as daily, weekly, semimonthly, monthly and early.
 * **Recurring Billing Frequency**. Number of billing periods that make up one billing cycle.
The combination of billing frequency and billing period must be less than or equal to one year. For example, if the billing cycle is Month, the maximum value for billing frequency is 12. Similarly, if the billing cycle is Week, the maximum value for billing frequency is 52.
Note: If the billing period is SemiMonth, the billing frequency must be 1.
Example: Billing Period = Month; Billing Frequency = 3; means every 3 months or quarterly
 * **Recurring Billing Cycles**. Number of billing cycles for payment period.
For the regular payment period, if no value is specified or the value is 0, the regular payment period continues until the profile is canceled or deactivated.
For the regular payment period, if the value is greater than 0, the regular payment period will expire after the trial period is finished and continue at the billing frequency for the specified number of cycles
Example: Billing Period = Month; Billing Frequency = 1; Cycles = 10 means every months for the next 10 months. The same parameters are available for setting up the trial billing.
